                    <p>At Pet Haven, we believe every pet deserves a loving home. Our mission is to bridge the gap between homeless animals and compassionate adopters by creating a simple, transparent, and caring adoption platform.</p>
                    <p>We partner with trusted animal shelters, rescue organizations, and foster homes to bring you pets who are ready to be adopted. Whether you're looking for a playful puppy, a gentle senior dog, or a cuddly cat, you'll find them here.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is not only to help pets find homes but also to guide families in making responsible adoption choices. By choosing adoption, you're not just bringing joy into your life â€” you're giving an animal a second chance at happiness.</p>
                    <b className='text-gray-800'>Our Mission</b>
                    <p>To connect loving families with rescued pets while promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare in our community.</p>
